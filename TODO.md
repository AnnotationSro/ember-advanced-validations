- [ ] document predefined validations (don't forget about documenting validationMessages, too!)
- [X] *runIf* option to make validations run conditionally - either based on fields' values or based on other validations ("why run *this* validation when *that* validation failed?")
- [ ] create a blueprint to generate a new validation
- [ ] create a helper _isFieldValid_ - it gets validation result and field name as parameters and returns true/false ( or maybe even validation message)
